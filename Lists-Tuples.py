# List Methods:
# For example: List = [2, 1, 3]
# 1- List.append(4) - This method will add one more value to the list of the variable of the list [2, 1, 3, 4]
# 2- List.sort() - This method will sort the list in an ascending Order [1, 2, 3]
# 3- List.sort(reverse = True) - This method will sort the list in a descending order [3, 2, 1]
# 4- list.reverse() - This method will reverse the list [3, 1, 2]
# 5- list.insert(idx, el) - This method will insert element at the index.
# 6- list.remove() - This method removes first occurence of element in the list.
# 7- list.pop() - This method removes a particular element at index.

# List Data is also Mutable. It can change the value of the variable after being created unlike (Str, Int and Tuple) For Example:
