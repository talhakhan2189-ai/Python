### Python
## My Python Bootcamp Journey

# Hi there!
Over the past 4 months, I’ve been part of a really intense 12 week, full-time, bootcamp with Generation UK&I,, where I learned and practiced all the core concepts of Python programming. This repo is basically a collection of everything I’ve studied and worked on during that time.

I didn’t just watch tutorials. I made sure to get hands-on with every topic by doing exercises, writing my own scripts, and really trying to understand how things work by building them myself.

# What I Covered

Here’s a quick overview of the main topics I worked through:
Variables & Data Types – understanding strings, integers, floats, booleans, and how to use them.
Lists & Tuples – how to store and work with collections of data.
Dictionaries & Sets – working with key-value pairs and unique items.
User Input – gathering and handling input from users.
Loops – using for and while loops to repeat tasks.
Functions – writing reusable code with arguments and return values.
Classes & Object-Oriented Programming – creating objects, using inheritance, and building more structured programs.
Files & Exceptions – reading from and writing to files, and handling errors gracefully.

# How I Learned

The bootcamp was structured around learning the theory first, then applying it right away. So for every topic, I practiced by:
Writing scripts from scratch
Solving coding exercises and challenges
Building mini projects to apply what I learned
Testing and debugging my own code
Everything in this repo shows the progression of my learning from the basics all the way to more complex topics.
Repo Structure

I’ve organized the files by topic so it’s easy to follow:
01_variables_and_data_types/
02_lists_and_tuples/
03_dictionaries/
04_user_input_and_loops/
05_functions/
06_classes_and_oop/
07_files_and_exceptions/
08_projects_and_exercises/
README.md
Each folder contains practice files and exercises I worked on as I went through each part of the course.
Why I Made This

This repo is mainly for me to look back on what I’ve learned, but also to show potential employers what I’ve done and how far I’ve come. It’s been a challenging but really rewarding experience, and I’m excited to keep building on these skills in real-world projects.
